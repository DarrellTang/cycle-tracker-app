# Task ID: 1
# Title: Flutter Project Setup & Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Flutter project with the required dependencies and establish the foundational architecture for the Cycle Tracker App.
# Details:
1. Create a new Flutter project using the latest stable version
2. Configure for both iOS and Android platforms
3. Set up the project structure following clean architecture principles:
   - data/ (repositories, data sources)
   - domain/ (entities, use cases)
   - presentation/ (UI, view models)
4. Add required dependencies in pubspec.yaml:
   - sqflite for local database
   - provider or riverpod for state management
   - fl_chart for visualization
   - table_calendar for calendar views
   - flutter_local_notifications for notifications
   - local_auth for biometric authentication
5. Configure app theme with support for dark mode
6. Set up navigation using Navigator 2.0 or GoRouter
7. Create CI/CD pipeline configuration

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project builds successfully on both iOS and Android
2. Run flutter analyze to ensure code quality
3. Create basic widget tests for the app scaffold
4. Test navigation between placeholder screens
5. Verify theme switching functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Flutter Installation and Project Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Flutter SDK and create a new project with the recommended structure
### Details:
1. Install Flutter SDK: Download from flutter.dev and add to PATH
2. Run 'flutter doctor' to verify installation
3. Install Android Studio and/or Xcode
4. Create project: 'flutter create my_app --org com.example'
5. Verify setup: 'cd my_app && flutter run'

Common pitfalls:
- PATH configuration issues - ensure flutter/bin is in your PATH
- Android SDK license agreements not accepted
- Missing Xcode tools on macOS

## 2. Dependency Management Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure essential packages and organize dependencies in pubspec.yaml
### Details:
1. Open pubspec.yaml in project root
2. Add core dependencies:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     provider: ^6.0.0  # State management
     http: ^0.13.5  # API requests
     shared_preferences: ^2.0.15  # Local storage
     flutter_bloc: ^8.1.1  # Alternative state management
   ```
3. Run 'flutter pub get'
4. Create a dependencies.dart file to centralize imports

Common pitfalls:
- Version conflicts between packages
- Incorrect YAML indentation
- Missing 'flutter pub get' after changes

## 3. Implement Clean Architecture Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up project folders following clean architecture principles
### Details:
1. Create these directories in lib/:
   - /presentation (UI components)
     - /screens
     - /widgets
   - /domain (Business logic)
     - /entities
     - /repositories (interfaces)
     - /usecases
   - /data (Data sources)
     - /repositories (implementations)
     - /datasources
     - /models
   - /core (Shared utilities)

2. Create sample files in each directory
3. Implement dependency injection using provider or get_it package

Common pitfalls:
- Circular dependencies
- Mixing concerns between layers
- Overly complex folder structure for beginners

## 4. Navigation and Routing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Implement app navigation system with named routes
### Details:
1. Create a router.dart file in lib/core/
2. Define route names as constants:
   ```dart
   class Routes {
     static const String home = '/';
     static const String details = '/details';
   }
   ```
3. Set up route generation:
   ```dart
   Route<dynamic> generateRoute(RouteSettings settings) {
     switch (settings.name) {
       case Routes.home:
         return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => HomeScreen());
       default:
         return MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => NotFoundScreen());
     }
   }
   ```
4. Configure in main.dart:
   ```dart
   MaterialApp(
     onGenerateRoute: generateRoute,
     initialRoute: Routes.home,
   )
   ```

Common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to register routes
- Navigation state management issues
- Not handling unknown routes

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment for the Flutter project
### Details:
1. Create a .github/workflows directory in project root
2. Add flutter-ci.yml file:
   ```yaml
   name: Flutter CI
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
           with:
             flutter-version: '3.3.0'
         - run: flutter pub get
         - run: flutter analyze
         - run: flutter test
   ```
3. Configure Firebase App Distribution or Codemagic for deployment
4. Add a README.md with build status badge

Common pitfalls:
- Missing environment secrets
- Not caching build dependencies
- Insufficient test coverage
- Platform-specific build issues
