# Task ID: 14
# Title: Data Export & Backup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement functionality for exporting and backing up profile data locally without cloud sync, maintaining privacy while allowing data preservation.
# Details:
1. Create secure data export functionality
2. Implement JSON and CSV export formats
3. Add backup creation to local storage
4. Create backup restoration interface
5. Implement scheduled automatic backups
6. Add backup encryption
7. Create backup management screen
8. Implement selective data export by profile
9. Add data export password protection
10. Create backup verification system

# Test Strategy:
1. Test export functionality with various data volumes
2. Verify exported data format integrity
3. Test backup creation and restoration
4. Verify encryption of exported data
5. Test selective export functionality
6. Integration tests for backup management
7. Verify password protection works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Secure Data Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a secure data export system that allows users to export their data in CSV format with privacy considerations.
### Details:
Develop a module that extracts user data from the database, formats it into CSV, ensures all sensitive data is properly handled, implements rate limiting to prevent abuse, and provides clear user feedback during the export process. Ensure exports are local-only and no data is sent to external servers.

## 2. Create Backup Creation and Restoration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop functionality to create complete application backups and restore from them when needed.
### Details:
Implement a backup system that captures all user data in a compressed format, creates a verification checksum, provides clear progress indicators during backup/restore operations, and includes error handling for interrupted processes. Ensure the restoration process validates backup integrity before proceeding.

## 3. Implement Encryption for Backups [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Add strong encryption capabilities to the backup system to ensure data security.
### Details:
Integrate AES-256 encryption for backup files, implement secure key generation and management, create a password-based encryption option for users, add visual indicators for encrypted vs non-encrypted backups, and ensure encryption doesn't significantly impact performance.

## 4. Develop Backup Management Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Create a user-friendly interface for managing backups and exports.
### Details:
Design and implement a dedicated section in the app for backup management, including features to view backup history, delete old backups, schedule automatic backups, display backup size and creation date, and provide clear instructions for users on how to manage their data.

## 5. Test Data Portability and Recovery Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Thoroughly test all export and backup functionality across different scenarios to ensure reliability.
### Details:
Create and execute test cases for various export formats, backup sizes, interrupted operations, corrupted backups, cross-device restoration, and edge cases like low storage situations. Document recovery procedures and create user-facing help content explaining the backup and restore process.
