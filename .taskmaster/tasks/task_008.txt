# Task ID: 8
# Title: Daily Observation Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the daily observation logging system allowing users to quickly record mood, energy, and custom notes for each profile.
# Details:
1. Design quick-entry interface for daily observations
2. Implement logging for:
   - Mood selection (happy, neutral, irritable, anxious)
   - Energy level slider (1-5)
   - Custom notes field
   - Time-stamped entries
3. Create DailyLog repository and data model
4. Add observation history view
5. Implement reminder system for daily logging
6. Create dashboard widgets showing recent observations
7. Add photo attachment option for observations
8. Implement search functionality for notes

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for DailyLog repository
2. Widget tests for quick-entry interface
3. Integration tests for observation history view
4. Test time-stamping accuracy
5. Verify reminder functionality
6. Usability testing to ensure logging takes <30 seconds

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Quick-Entry Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user-friendly interface for rapid observation logging that's accessible from the main screen
### Details:
Design and implement a quick-entry form that allows users to log observations with minimal friction. Include fields for observation text, automatic timestamp capture, and optional mood/category selection. The interface should be accessible via a prominent button on the main screen and support both short notes and longer reflections. Use Material Design components for consistency.

## 2. Implement Observation Data Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create the data structure and storage mechanism for observation entries
### Details:
Develop a robust data model for storing observations, including fields for content, timestamp, categories/tags, and mood indicators. Implement database schema, repository pattern for data access, and necessary CRUD operations. Ensure proper indexing for efficient retrieval and consider encryption for sensitive content.

## 3. Create History View [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a chronological view of past observations with filtering and search capabilities
### Details:
Build a scrollable timeline view that displays past observations in reverse chronological order. Implement filtering by date range, category, and mood. Add search functionality to find specific content. Include options for editing and deleting past entries, with appropriate confirmation dialogs. Design the UI to clearly show timestamps and provide visual differentiation between different types of entries.

## 4. Implement Reminder System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a configurable reminder system to encourage regular observation logging
### Details:
Develop a notification system that reminds users to log observations at configurable intervals. Include options for daily, weekly, or custom schedules. Implement respectful notification practices with user-configurable quiet hours. Create a settings interface for managing reminder preferences and ensure notifications deep-link directly to the quick-entry form when tapped.

## 5. Integrate with Main Application Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Ensure seamless integration of the observation logging feature with the rest of the application
### Details:
Connect the observation logging feature to the main application navigation and workflow. Add entry points from relevant screens, implement proper state management to preserve draft entries, and ensure consistent styling throughout. Test the complete user journey from receiving a reminder to viewing logged observations in the history view. Document the integration points for future maintenance.
