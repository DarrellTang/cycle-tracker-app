# Task ID: 13
# Title: Phase-Specific Feature Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the detailed tracking and support features specific to each menstrual cycle phase (Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal).
# Details:
1. Create phase-specific tracking interfaces for:
   - Menstrual (days 1-5): heavy flow tracking, cramp severity, fatigue levels, need for rest
   - Follicular (days 1-13): rising energy, improved mood, motivation tracking
   - Ovulation (days 12-17): peak confidence, social energy, communication skills
   - Luteal (days 15-28): PMS symptoms, irritability, bloating, food cravings
2. Implement phase-specific support suggestion display
3. Create phase information screens with educational content
4. Add phase-specific symptom tracking
5. Implement phase comparison across cycles
6. Create phase duration customization interface
7. Add phase-specific activity recommendations

# Test Strategy:
1. Widget tests for phase-specific interfaces
2. Verify correct phase detection and display
3. Test phase-specific symptom tracking
4. Integration tests for phase information screens
5. Verify support suggestions match current phase
6. Test phase customization functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Phase-Specific Tracking Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create unique tracking interfaces for each menstrual cycle phase (Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal) with appropriate metrics and visualization.
### Details:
Design and implement four distinct tracking interfaces: 1) Menstrual phase (days 1-5): heavy flow tracking, cramp severity, fatigue levels, need for rest, 2) Follicular phase (days 1-13): rising energy, improved mood, motivation tracking, 3) Ovulation phase (days 12-17): peak confidence, social energy, communication skills tracking, 4) Luteal phase (days 15-28): PMS symptoms, irritability, bloating, food cravings. Each interface should have appropriate data visualization (charts, calendars) and phase-appropriate color schemes/imagery.

## 2. Implement Support Suggestion Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop phase-specific support suggestion algorithms that provide relevant resources based on tracked symptoms and user inputs.
### Details:
Create support suggestion systems for each phase: 1) Menstrual: comfort measures for cramps, self-care activities for fatigue, nutrition for iron loss, 2) Follicular: activities to harness rising energy, productivity tools for improved focus, 3) Ovulation: social event suggestions, communication enhancement tips, confidence-building activities, 4) Luteal: mood management techniques, bloating reduction strategies, healthy alternatives for food cravings. Include personalized suggestions based on symptom severity and user preferences.

## 3. Create Phase-Specific Educational Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop educational content libraries tailored to each menstrual cycle phase with appropriate delivery mechanisms.
### Details:
Develop content for: 1) Menstrual: understanding menstrual flow patterns, managing period pain, when to seek medical help, 2) Follicular: hormonal changes during this phase, optimal exercise types, cognitive benefits, 3) Ovulation: fertility awareness, physical signs of ovulation, hormonal influences on social behavior, 4) Luteal: understanding PMS, hormonal fluctuations, sleep optimization strategies. Include science-based articles, short videos, and interactive tools explaining hormonal influences on physical and emotional states during each phase.

## 4. Develop Symptom Tracking Specialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Implement specialized symptom tracking features for each menstrual cycle phase with appropriate analysis and visualization tools.
### Details:
Create specialized tracking for: 1) Menstrual: flow intensity (light/medium/heavy), cramp severity, fatigue levels, headaches, body temperature, 2) Follicular: energy levels, mood improvements, motivation metrics, focus ability, creative inspiration, 3) Ovulation: confidence levels, social energy, libido changes, cervical mucus changes, mittelschmerz (ovulation pain), 4) Luteal: PMS symptom severity, irritability levels, bloating intensity, specific food cravings, sleep quality. Include trend analysis across cycles and pattern recognition to help users identify their unique cycle patterns.

## 5. Implement Phase Comparison Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Create tools that allow users to compare experiences across different menstrual cycle phases and across multiple cycles.
### Details:
Develop features that: 1) Allow users to compare symptom severity across different phases within a single cycle, 2) Enable comparison of the same phase across multiple cycles (e.g., comparing luteal phase symptoms from the last three cycles), 3) Create phase-specific milestone visualizations showing typical vs. user's actual experience, 4) Implement predictive features that forecast upcoming phase changes based on historical data. Include data visualization tools like comparative charts and cycle overlays to help users identify patterns in their menstrual health.
