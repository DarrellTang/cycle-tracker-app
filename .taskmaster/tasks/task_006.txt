# Task ID: 6
# Title: Symptom Tracking System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the symptom tracking functionality allowing users to log and visualize physical and emotional symptoms for each profile.
# Details:
1. Create symptom tracking models for:
   - Physical symptoms (energy, cramps, headaches, bloating, appetite, sleep)
   - Emotional symptoms (mood, stability, social preference, stress, needs)
2. Implement rating scales (1-5) for symptom severity
3. Design intuitive symptom logging interface
4. Create symptom history visualization using fl_chart
5. Implement symptom correlation analysis
6. Add symptom pattern recognition for predictions
7. Create symptom summary views by cycle and phase
8. Implement quick-entry for common symptoms

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for symptom data models
2. Widget tests for symptom logging interface
3. Integration tests for symptom visualization
4. Test pattern recognition with sample datasets
5. Verify symptom correlation analysis
6. Usability testing for quick-entry workflow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Symptom Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive data models for tracking externally observable symptoms including mood, energy levels, irritability, and social preferences.
### Details:
Design database schema with the following components: 1) Core symptom categories (mood, energy, irritability, social engagement) with severity scales (1-10), 2) Timestamp and duration tracking, 3) Observer relationship field (partner/parent/self), 4) Contextual factors (time of day, activities, medication timing), 5) Notes field for qualitative observations. Ensure models support both discrete measurements and trend analysis over time.

## 2. Develop Symptom Logging Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create an intuitive interface for partners/parents to log observable symptoms with minimal friction.
### Details:
Build a mobile-responsive form with: 1) Quick-select buttons for common symptoms, 2) Slider controls for intensity levels, 3) Relationship selector (who is logging), 4) Time/duration pickers with defaults to current time, 5) Optional context fields, 6) Voice-to-text for notes field. Design for accessibility and ensure completion time under 30 seconds for routine entries.

## 3. Implement Quick-Entry System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Develop a streamlined quick-entry system for frequent symptom logging with minimal input requirements.
### Details:
Create a system with: 1) Customizable templates for common symptom combinations, 2) One-tap entry from notification/widget, 3) Default values for time and observer, 4) Batch entry option for logging multiple symptoms at once, 5) Voice command integration for hands-free logging. Include ability to edit entries later with more detail if needed.

## 4. Create Symptom Visualization Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop interactive visualizations to display symptom patterns over time with filtering capabilities.
### Details:
Build visualization components including: 1) Timeline charts showing symptom intensity over days/weeks/months, 2) Correlation views between different symptoms, 3) Time-of-day heat maps showing when symptoms typically occur, 4) Comparison views between observer reports (partner vs. self-reporting), 5) Export functionality for sharing with healthcare providers. Ensure visualizations are interactive and responsive across device sizes.

## 5. Implement Pattern Recognition System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.4
### Description: Develop an algorithm to identify patterns in symptom data and provide insights on potential triggers and trends.
### Details:
Create a pattern recognition system that: 1) Identifies correlations between symptoms and contextual factors, 2) Detects cyclical patterns in mood and energy levels, 3) Highlights potential triggers based on statistical analysis, 4) Generates weekly/monthly reports summarizing key insights, 5) Provides customizable alerts for significant changes in symptom patterns. Include confidence levels for all identified patterns and allow user feedback to improve accuracy.
